Name:  Sam Yu

Lecture section:  Mon/Wed at 9:30am

Recitation day and time:  Fri at 10am

Assignment #:  5

Program due date:  4/23/19

Handed in date:  4/23/19

Source code file name(s):

LargeInteger.java
RsaKeyGen.java
RsaSign.java





Other file name(s) (if relevant):
None



Does your program run without error?:No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
My RSA gen and RsaSign work very well up to 512-bit. Sometimes you will get a bad mod inverse and you will need to run the generation again.



Additional comments to the grader:
I used BigInteger to implement the multiply, gcd and mod inverse functions.I really tried to use Kratasubas algorthim to create the multiplication and I just can't get it to work properly. I probably should have gone with the gradeschool methods I guess. I have taken this class three times now and I just can't even get this multiplcation but I got the RSA just fine. I'm just trying to graduate this semester and was hoping I might be able to get some partial credit for the multiplication part after all the years I've spent on it. Thanks!
