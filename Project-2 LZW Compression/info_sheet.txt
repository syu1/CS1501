Does your program run without error?:

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
Everything runs correctly except reset and monitored expansion don't expand the last little bit. It cycles through just through resetting everything then stops randomly at i = 517 for some reason. 
I think I'm having small syncing issue with an off by 1 error somewhere.

Additional comments to the grader:
I implemented Monitor mode compression to what was definied in the rubric. I'm pretty sure I did it correctly.
